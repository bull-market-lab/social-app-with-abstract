# Social App with Abstract SDK

Following abstract's MyFi idea, we built 2 abstract modules (i.e. cosmwasm contracts)

- Friend Tech module: similar to standard friend tech but fund is stored locally at each issuer's account. Supports issue key, buy key and sell key.
- QA module: QA style social app on top of friend tech module, anyone can ask another user questions based on the answerer's key price (currently hardcode to price of buying 1 key).
